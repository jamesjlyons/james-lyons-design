#### About the project

Shortly after joining the Analytics Cloud team at [Liferay](https://www.liferay.com), I had the chance to work on the new A/B testing feature for the platform. The team kicked-off the project with a design sprint, and after that, I was the sole designer working on the Analytics Cloud side of the project.
<br /><br />

My responsibilities for this project included:

- Establishing a cross-product user flow and getting approval from multiple stakeholders
- Collaborating with a designer from Liferay DXP to ensure cross-product consistency
- Working within and expanding upon our design system to build the A/B testing UI on Analytics Cloud
- Working internationally with our development team in Brazil
  <br /><br />

The resulting feature was deeply integrated with Liferay's Digital Experience Platform (DXP). It solved users' needs for having a way to run A/B tests within Liferay's product ecosystem. Leveraging the site-building capabilities in DXP, users can quickly make a new A/B test on any page and select an element to track click events on if necessary for the desired metric to be measured. Users can also select a target audience built by our audience segment creator, so the can run tests on personalizations of a page. Liferay's Analytics Cloud then does the heavy lifting tracking and reporting the data for the test and eventually gives the user a test result, with the handy option to publish the winning variant directly from the report. Although it was very much an MVP for an A/B testing feature, it meets our customers' basic needs and has laid the groundwork for future enhancements like multivariate and redirect testing.
