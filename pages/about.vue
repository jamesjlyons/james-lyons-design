    <h3>About me</h3>
    <h6>What I do and what I've done</h6>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      I am a Sr. Product Designer and Front-End Developer at
      <a href="https://soberlink.com" target="_blank">Soberlink</a> in Southern
      California.<br />
      <br />
      I also currently design and code stuff with
      <a href="https://tapfive.dev" target="_blank">Tap Five</a>, a team of two
      who like to make things that don't suck. <br />
      <br />

      Before this was a Product Designer at
      <a href="https://liferay.com" target="_blank">Liferay</a>. I worked on the
      Analytics Cloud product team. In my spare time, I made a handy
      <a
        href="https://github.com/jamesjlyons/figma-liferay-text-style-switcher"
        target="_blank"
        >Figma plugin</a
      >
      to help our process there. <br />
      <br />
      I previously worked as the Lead Designer at
      <a href="https://grandpad.net" target="_blank">GrandPad</a>. I was the
      first designer the startup had hired in its three years of existence, and
      I did much of the front-end development for the main website and checkout.
      During my time there, I established a UX design process within the company
      by encouraging user research, idea validation, and interactive prototype
      testing. I helped raise the quality of product designs by establishing
      cohesive visual patterns across websites and mobile apps. I led the
      process of two different website redesigns, launched iOS and Android app
      redesigns, set up A/B tests, designed and coded emails, and did some minor
      branding work. <br /><br />
      I graduated from Cal State Fullerton with a BFA in Graphic Design.<br /><br />
      You can find me on
